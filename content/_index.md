# Mothership Docs

Mothership is **configuration as a service** for a variety of use cases: microservices, serverless (e.g. Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc),
mobile apps, internet of things, and pretty much any other device or service that can access the public internet.

This documentation provides expanded information on using our various SDKs and use-cases for Mothership as a whole. We welcome contributions to this
documentation via our GitHub repo! If you have comments, questions, or just need additional help on a topic, feel free to open an GitHub issue or raise
a support ticket.
